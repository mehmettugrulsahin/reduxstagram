# A simple React Redux implementation

This is a demo built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/), ES6 and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). It illustrates storing state in one place via Redux, and then using controllers to "glue" that state to the views.
